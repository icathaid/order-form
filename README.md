# order-form

I started this pretty far behind and had to stop and go back to my busmall project for a while to work my way though the local storage stuff.  

I didn't get very far, but I got a LOT further than when I was just trying to brute force my way through it.  

I'm turning in what I have because it's as far as I'm going to get with it with the time I can afford to throw at it.  After project week I'd really like to finish it up and incorporate it in my actual busmall project but it's time to focus on what's ahead.

I fell asleep working on this again so I'm not even 100% sure where I left off.  My initial version of this would return the index position of each product after clicking on it, but I deleted that at some point while trying to fix something and never re-implemented it.  

I popped back over to my busmall project to get a better handle on the localStorage aspect but I didn't get around to putting what I learned back into this project.  I got a little bit more built out with the dropdowns and input forms before I fell asleep.
