# order-form

I am so far behind on the lab that this is built on that I'm still chasing my tail trying to get data into and out of local storage in any kind of meaningful way.  

I deleted the only working function I had trying to do something, then got interrupted, and now i have no idea what i was in the middle of trying to do.  

The closest I got was that clicking on something from the dropdown would record its index in an array in local storage and return the index position to the user.  I can use this to drive a click counter but I don't have any idea how to have an input field for quantity or any of the other goals.  At this point I feel like it will be faster to go back and catch up on everything in order than to keep trying to brute force a bunch of methods I have no idea how to actually use.
